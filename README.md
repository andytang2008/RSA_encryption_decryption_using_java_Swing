# RSA_encryption_decryption_using_java_Swing
By using Java Swing, you could open the plain text file to encrypt, and save the encrypted text into a new binary file. The standard to enrypt is RSA. The plaintext file size cannot be more thant 245 bytes. 

Be advised, RSA is just for use of encryption of small text. If you want encrypt large file, your could use AES and select RSA to encrypt the password.
