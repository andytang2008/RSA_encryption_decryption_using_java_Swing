# RSA_encryption_decryption_using_java_Swing
By using Java Swing, you could open the plain text file to encrypt, and save the encrypted text into a new binary file. The standard to enrypt is RSA. The plaintext file size cannot be more than 245 bytes. 

Be advised, RSA is just for the use of encryption of small texts. If you want encrypt large file, your could use AES and select RSA to encrypt the password.
